## Good Afternoon,
I'm Joseph, a Programmer/Mathematician based in San Diego, California. Currently, I'm looking for
entry level positions/ internships, excited and enthusiastic to initiate my professional career.
As the job market is tough right now, and idle hands are the the devils plaything, I've striven to
remain as active as ever, reading, educating, teaching myself new things -- being the 'captain of my own soul.'
Here, I list some of those activities, for possible commendation or derision, or *attention*.
