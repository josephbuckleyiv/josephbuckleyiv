## Good Afternoon,
I'm Joseph, a Programmer/Mathematician based in San Diego, California. Currently, I'm looking for
entry level positions/ internships, excited and enthusiastic to initiate my professional career.
As the job market is tough right now, and idle hands are the the devils plaything, I've striven to
remain as active as ever, reading, educating, teaching myself new things -- being the 'captain of my own soul.'
Here, I list some of those activities, for possible commendation or derision, or at the very least as a way for you
to poke the man to see if he's still living.
## Current Project
 I'm delving into the world of observability and instrumenting applications. Specifically, I'm using the OpenTelemetry
 specification to define my collection and use of Metric data, in a Full-stack ASP.NET app that then uses said data, to paint
 a real-time charts on a TS React client. Leveraging Ring-Buffers and Sqlite, I've gotten it to work 'offline' smooth as butter: the goal, then, is for a
 seemless transition online, and architecting for scalability. This will ensure tolerance for possible network failure, and a cloud-ready approach
 to solving an everpresent problem in today's cumulonimbus world.
